      |Her green plastic watering can for
      |her fake Chinese rubber plant
      |In the fake plastic earth
      |
      |What she bought from a rubber man
      |In a town full of rubber bands
      |to get rid of itself
      |
      |It wears her out, it wears her out
      |It wears her out, it wears her out
      |
      |She lives with a broken man
      |A cracked polystyreneman
      |Who just crumbles and burns
      |
      |He used to do surgery
      |For girls in the eighties
      |But gravity always wins
      |
      |And it wears him out, it wears him out
      |It wears him out, it wears him
      |
      |She Looks like the real thing
      |She tastes like the real thing
      |My fake plastic love
      |
      |But I can't help the feeling
      |I could blow through the ceiling
      |If I just turn and run
      |
      |And it wears me out, it wears me out
      |It wears me out, it wears me out
      |
      |If i could be who you wanted
      |If i could be who you wanted all the time, all the time

      |The heart is a bloom
      |Shoots up through the stony ground
      |There's no room
      |No space to rent in this town

      |You're out of luck
      |And the reason that you had to care
      |The traffic is stuck
      |And you're not movin' anywhere
      |
      |You thought you'd found a friend
      |To take you out of this place
      |Someone you could lend a hand
      |In return for grace

      |It's a beautiful day

      |You're on the road
      |But you've got no destination
      |You're in the mud
      |In the maze of her imagination

      |Take me to that other place
      |Teach me
      |I know I'm not a hopeless case
      |
      |See the world in green and blue
      |See China right in front of you
      |See the canyons broken by cloud
      |See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
      |
      |See the Bedouin fires at night
      |See the oil fields at first light
      |And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
      |After the flood all the colors came out
      |(Day!)
      |
      |It was a beautiful day
      |Don't let it get away
      |Beautiful day
